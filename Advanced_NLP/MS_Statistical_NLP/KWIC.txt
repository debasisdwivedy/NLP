In 1786, I found, that in Germany they were engaged in aspecies of political inquiry, to which they had given the name ofStatistics; and though I apply a different idea to that word, forby Statistical is meant in Germany, an inquiry for the purposeof ascertaining the political strength of a country, or questionsrespecting matters of state; whereas, the idea I annex to theterm, is an inquiry into the state of a country, for the purposeof ascertaining the quantum of happiness enjoyed by itsinhabitants, and the means of its future improvement; yet, asI thought that a new word might attract more public attention,I resolved on adopting it.
